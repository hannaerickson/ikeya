Today was our first day of coding for our project.  Our group worked as a unit during the entire day and completed the coding as a team.  We completed the setup portion of the project, including creating our Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml file.  We also setup our PostgreSQL database and developed our GET and POST for our Rooms endpoint.  Although the FASTAPI instructional videos were extremely helpful, I found that coding through the FASTAPI as a group really helped formalize my knowledge.

Today was my first day "driving" while peer programming.  Our team worked as a group to add a Furniture model with a GET and POST route.  We also added a GET one and DELETE route for the rooms.  Our group also completed our exploration on authentication, so that we can begin the process of adding authentication to our web application. We ran into a few issues when adding authentication, so we ultimately decided to wait until the lecture to continue the process of adding authentication.

Our ah-ha moment was we started noticing patterns in our errors, so I started writing down common errors that we have come across, so I can reference them in the future.

Our team updated the furniture routes, so that we can get furniture for a specific room, I was driving for this portion of the pair programming. We also worked as a team for a significant part of today working on getting our authentication up and running.  

Our ah-ha moment was that we were able to figure out how to add a portion of our authentication (which was tricky for us).

Our team updated the Furniture model with a "ON DELETE CASCADE". Previously when we would try to delete a room with furniture in it, we would get an error message and were unable to delete the room.  Now that the "ON DELETE CASCADE" has been added to the furniture model, we are able to delete the rooms with furniture without any issues.  Abdoul was able to create this change for us, and solved one of the issues that we encountered last week. 

Our ah-ha moment for the day was
