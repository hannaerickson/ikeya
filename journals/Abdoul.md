 ## January 5th:
Created some design service routes and queries for our project. Had a bit of a road bump with our fastapi though, as we forgot to add some variables created within other queries to other files, as they are connected by way of a foreign key.

### January 6th:
Were making authentication tokens for our login and logout routes, which was a real pain in the butt. After some clarification though, we were able to make a breakthrough and get them mostly working. Just have to iron out a few kinks and we'll be good to go.

#### January 9th:
Fixed that pesky delete function today. Just had to add ON DELETE CASCADE to our table file, as we had a foreign key which was affecting our delete function.
### January 10th:
Trying to get the login function working, been a real pain the in the butt but we've made some good progress.

#### January 13th:
Tyler and I are trying to get the user logged-in view on the front end side of things working today, but we're struggling on where we would need to put an if statement for this code so we can filter the users views from each other.

### January 17th:
Hanna and I were able to get the route for our retrieving all the rooms from a single user rather than all the users working today. Just had to change the name of the route!
